# Resize-Sharp-Imgs
This project  is considered beginner-friendly as it discusses the concepts of Sharpening images using OpenCV with the help of the sharpening kernels (filters) and functions implemented in Opencv.
It also covers resizing images manuallay and with a trackbar.
The code was written on jupyter notebook and uploaded to github.
Two sharpening kernels with different values were used in this project to show the effect of these values on the resultant sharpened image.
